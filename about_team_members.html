                        <p>I was born on March 12, 2002. I am from Guba and I am a BBA student at ADA. Although I am a BBA student, working with websites is not new to me: I used Wix, a website builder. Regardless, I am new to coding. I like to learn new things, always be the best in my field, control my emotions and make marginal decisions. My hobbies are snowboarding, creating or editing videos, and finding occasions where I can use my creativity without limits.</p>
